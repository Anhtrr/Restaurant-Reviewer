## Description of Restaurant Reviewer

# Product Vision
For students, and adults alike, Restaurant Reivewer emulates a platform such as Yelp, but allows users to rate more aspects of a restaurant. Some of these are staff, ambiance, and service.

## History and how to contribute

Restaurant Reviewer was created as a student project in a class named "Remote Development" taught by Evan Korth in the Computer Science department at New York University. This is an interesting project, as the individual who thought of the product was no longer interested in contributing to it. Restaurant Reviewer allowed us to practice full stack development as a team. This project was also a way to practice and learn Agile methodologies and SCRUM; we did regular standups, demos, and sprint planning sessions. 


## How to build and test the project

3. In a separate terminal, run "npm install" in the parent folder
4. Run "npm start" within both windows
